## load data

```{r}

# Load Necessary Libraries
library(dplyr) # For data manipulation

# Load the Red Wine Data
red_wine = read.csv("winequality-red.csv", sep = ";")

# Load the White Wine Data
white_wine = read.csv("winequality-white.csv", sep = ";")

# Add a Categorical Variable for Wine Type
red_wine$type = "Red"
white_wine$type = "White"

# Combine the Two Datasets
wine_data = bind_rows(red_wine, white_wine)


# Convert 'type' to a Factor
wine_data$type = as.factor(wine_data$type)

# Categorize the 'alcohol' Predictor
wine_data$alcohol_category = cut(
  wine_data$alcohol,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 10, 12, Inf), # Define the thresholds for "Low", "Medium", "High"
  labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High")
)

# Convert to a Factor
wine_data$alcohol_category = as.factor(wine_data$alcohol_category)

# View(wine_data)

```

## Data types


```{r}

str(wine_data)

```



## Fit additive Model

```{r}

model = lm(quality ~ ., data = wine_data)
summary(model)

```

## VIF Values


```{r}
if (!require(car)) install.packages("car")
library(car)

# Compute VIF Values
vif_values = vif(model)

# Display the VIF Values
vif_values


```

## Fit interaction model

```{r}


model = lm(quality ~ .^2, data = wine_data)
summary(model)


```

## Including Plots


```{r}

# Scatter plot: Volatile Acidity vs Quality
plot(wine_data$volatile.acidity, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Volatile Acidity vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Volatile Acidity",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "blue", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Residual Sugar vs Quality
plot(wine_data$residual.sugar, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Residual Sugar vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Residual Sugar",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "green", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)


# Scatter plot: Fixed Acidity vs Quality
plot(wine_data$fixed.acidity, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Fixed Acidity vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Fixed Acidity",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "purple", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Citric Acid vs Quality
plot(wine_data$citric.acid, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Citric Acid vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Citric Acid",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "orange", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Chlorides vs Quality
plot(wine_data$chlorides, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Chlorides vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Chlorides",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Free Sulfur Dioxide vs Quality
plot(wine_data$free.sulfur.dioxide, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Free Sulfur Dioxide vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Free Sulfur Dioxide",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "cyan", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Total Sulfur Dioxide vs Quality
plot(wine_data$total.sulfur.dioxide, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Total Sulfur Dioxide vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Total Sulfur Dioxide",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "brown", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Density vs Quality
plot(wine_data$density, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Density vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Density",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "pink", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: pH vs Quality
plot(wine_data$pH, wine_data$quality,
     main = "pH vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "pH",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "darkgreen", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

# Scatter plot: Sulphates vs Quality
plot(wine_data$sulphates, wine_data$quality,
     main = "Sulphates vs Wine Quality",
     xlab = "Sulphates",
     ylab = "Wine Quality",
     col = "darkblue", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

```

## Q-Q Plot

```{r}
qqnorm(resid(model), main = "Normal Q-Q Plot", col = "darkgrey")
qqline(resid(model), col = "dodgerblue", lwd = 2)
```

```{r}
shapiro.test(resid(model)[1:5000])
shapiro.test(resid(model)[length(resid(model)) - 5000:length(resid(model))])
```

Errors are not normally distributed. 5k is the max `shapiro.test` can handel.

## Equal valrience

```{r}
plot(fitted(model), resid(model), col = "grey", pch = 20,
     xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Data from Model 1")
abline(h = 0, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
```

```{r}
library(lmtest)
bptest(model)
```
