```{r setup}

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

```

## load data

```{r}

# Load Necessary Libraries
library(dplyr) # For data manipulation

# Load the Red Wine Data
red_wine = read.csv("winequality-red.csv", sep = ";")

# Load the White Wine Data
white_wine = read.csv("winequality-white.csv", sep = ";")

# Add a Categorical Variable for Wine Type
red_wine$type = "Red"
white_wine$type = "White"

# Combine the Two Datasets
wine_data = bind_rows(red_wine, white_wine)


# Convert 'type' to a Factor
wine_data$type = as.factor(wine_data$type)

nrow(wine_data)

# View(wine_data)

```

## Train-Test Data Split

```{r}
# Modified from Homework Week 11, Exercise 3
set.seed(420)
wine_trn_idx  = sample(nrow(wine_data), size = trunc(0.80 * nrow(wine_data)))
wine_trn_data = wine_data[wine_trn_idx, ]
wine_tst_data = wine_data[-wine_trn_idx, ]
```

## Data types


```{r}

str(wine_trn_data)

```



## Fit additive Model

```{r}

full_add_model = lm(quality ~ ., data = wine_trn_data) # Changed the name of this model to be more descriptive
summary(full_add_model)

```

## VIF Values


```{r}
if (!require(car)) install.packages("car")
library(car)

# Compute VIF Values
vif_values = vif(full_add_model)

# Display the VIF Values
vif_values


```

## Additional Collinearity and VIF Analysis



## Fit interaction model

```{r}


full_int_model = lm(quality ~ .^2, data = wine_trn_data) # Changed the name of this model to be more descriptive
summary(full_int_model)


```
