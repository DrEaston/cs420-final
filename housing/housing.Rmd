## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset
housing_data = read.csv("train.csv")

# View the dataset structure
str(housing_data)

# Basic data cleaning (remove rows with missing SalePrice or predictors)
housing_data_clean = housing_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(SalePrice)) %>%  # Ensure no missing SalePrice
  select(SalePrice, LotArea, OverallQual, YearBuilt, GarageCars, TotalBsmtSF, 
         GrLivArea, FullBath, Fireplaces, KitchenQual, Neighborhood) %>%  # Select at least 10 columns
  na.omit()  # Remove rows with missing values

# Convert categorical predictors to factors
housing_data_clean$KitchenQual = as.factor(housing_data_clean$KitchenQual)  # Kitchen Quality
housing_data_clean$Neighborhood = as.factor(housing_data_clean$Neighborhood)  # Neighborhood

# Fit a linear model
model = lm(SalePrice ~ ., data = housing_data_clean)

# Summary of the model
summary(model)

str(housing_data_clean)

```

## Including Plots


```{r }

# Scatter plot: GrLivArea vs SalePrice
plot(housing_data_clean$GrLivArea, housing_data_clean$SalePrice,
     main = "GrLivArea vs SalePrice",
     xlab = "Above-Ground Living Area (GrLivArea)",
     ylab = "Sale Price",
     col = "blue", pch = 19, cex = 0.5)

```
